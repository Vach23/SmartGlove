# SmartGlove
Independent school project - signal processing basics

The goal was get data from IMU and bend sensor and create somem controlling with analysing the signs. The first part was succesfully implemented with help of madgwick algoritm, the other part - easier one - wasnt finished. I would just probably bind some movements to keystrokes or something else.

### Hardware used:
MCU - Arduino Nano  
Bend sensor - Sparkfun Flex Sensor 4.5"  
IMU - MPU-9250

### Software
Arduino FW - Arduino IDE  
Visualisation - Python with PyGame & PyOpenGL  
Calibration - MATLAB - could be rewritten in Python

### Demonstration:
